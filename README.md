# Street Image Segmentation
Training a model using UNET and ResNet34 to do image segmentation on street images. [Image Segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). 

You can find more about the dataset [here](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/).

We can see that the predictions in this case were pretty accurate. It predicted the buildings, the trees, the vegetation, Bicyclist, Car(Auto), Road, Sign Symbol, Pole, fence. I don't think I have any complains with it.
